# CTC Ecoheat 400 Modbus
This repository contains my notes on how to do a custom adapter and configuration to 
connect CTC Ecoheat 400 heat pump to home automation system with Modbus and MQTT.

This repository is based on earlier work by [Kasper-73](https://github.com/kasper-73/CTC-GSi-8---Homeassistant) and 
[Spangsberg](https://github.com/Spangsberg/CTC-EcoHeat400---Homeassistant).
